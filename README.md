# ILI-Macro-Visual

Created by Gabriel Salinas

This is a quick and easy way to visualize In-Line-Intelligent pipeline data. I have uploaded two files with the same code. The Ipython file is formatted as a notebook and the user cannot access the matplot librarie's features to browse through the entire visual. The other file is .py and if executed from your favorite IDE will let you access matplot's easy features.

This ILI Macro Visual can be used for pre-construction information and reports, job planning, data quality, and organizing executed pipeline modifications. The main difference between this macro visual and a basic run sheet with only values is you can actually see a macro or whole visual of just a segment or the entire system. This macro visual will give you a better understanding of why and how anomalies may appear at certian sections of the pipeline. A run sheet is helpful when determining the details of a section of pipe but the raw valves can sometimes add to human error when executing intergrity inspections or assessing the pipeline section.

I wrote this program a couple years back and it needs optimization, but it will execute for now.

The .csv file with the ili run data is not run data from any tool or pipeline. This data was "made-up" or created to be only an example of pipeline ILI data... Let me repeat what I just wrote, This ILI run data is fictional, created out of thin air, doesn't relate to any pipe segment on earth, and just a figment of my imagination.  Theres only 5 index headers with this example file. Actual run data from a specific pipeline will have many more headers and indexes used for specific integrity purposes, however this sample data will show the user how to only visualize run data using minimal target variables.
